# lnscrapper

Basic scrapper that scrappes websites for light novels, website used for scrapping not included. Don't want to overload traffic there. 

It is possible to refactor the code so that it works for different websites.

This data produced by this script should work in conjuction with a future app that makes it possible to display in properl Lightnovel style.

Currently not happy with the way html is saved in JSON, will look for solution.
